A short guide to running Ghost in a production environment and setting it up to serve traffic at scale.


## Ghost(Pro)

The most efficient way to deploy a production-ready instance of Ghost is on our official fully-managed PaaS. **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing)** runs the exact same open source codebase and has no limitations compared to self hosting. It's the easiest way to save a lot of time installing and managing your environment.

## Self-hosting

For self-hosting Ghost in production our officially recommended stack is:

- **Ubuntu 16.04** or **18.04**
- MySQL 5.5, 5.6, or 5.7 (*not* >= 8.0)
- NGINX
- Systemd
- [Recommended Node version](/faq/node-versions/) installed via NodeSource
- A server with at least 1GB memory
- A non-root user for running `ghost` commands

**Ubuntu 16.04** and **Ubuntu 18.04** are the only officially supported operating systems. Our [Ubuntu install guide](/install/ubuntu/) walks you through how to get a server setup this way. 

Other operating systems may work fine and you're welcome to use them, but we are unable to assist with debugging or optimising for them at present - so you're on your own there. Our recommendation: Use Ubuntu, because that's where you'll have the fewest headaches.

#### Selecting a webhost

You can use just about any hosting provider which provides a reasonable VPS to work with. Ghost officially partners with [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), who also offer a pre-made [Ghost image](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/one-clicks/ghost/). We recommend them very highly.
